Filter
JavaScript's filter method serves as a powerful tool for selectively extracting elements from arrays based on certain conditions.


callback function
A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.


Array.every()	
The Array.every() method is used to check whether all the elements of the array satisfy the given condition or not.	


some
The Array.some() method is used to check whether at least one of the elements of the array satisfies the given condition or not.


map
map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. map() does not execute the function for empty elements. map() does not change the original array.
